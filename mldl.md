# Time Series Forecasting

Here, I have placed some projects about time series forecasting with statistical and Machine learning models.

## Prediction of hourly traffic intensity in Madrid city

In this project, the traffic insensity level of the most crowded district of Madrid city was estimated in every hour by implementing both statistical and Machine Learning models. UK crime data was analyzed for Greater London and Manchester areas and significant insigths from the data was shown with interactive visuals.
models in R. The data used in this project was obtained from the sensors placed in Madrid city.

## Time Series Forecasting of the annual exports of Turkey

In this study, the annual exports of Turkey has been analyzed and exports has been forecasted by statistical tools such as ETS.
