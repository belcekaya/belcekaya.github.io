Here, I have placed several projects that I worked on for reporting the significant data insights by using various data visualization software.

## Crime Analysis with Shiny App

In this shiny app, the UK crime data was analyzed for Greater London and Manchester areas and significant insigths from the data was shown with interactive visuals.
To show the app you can click the following link:
- [ShinyApp-Crime Analysis](https://l6l43h-belce.shinyapps.io/crime_analysis/)

To see the codes, you can go to the related repository with the following link:

## Network Analysis with Gephi

In this project a tool called `t-hoarder_kit` has been used in `Linux virtual machine` in order to collect a set of twitter accounts and tweets, that have later been processed in `Gephi` to obtain the declared and dynamic network. All the accounts examined are tweeting related with Climate change.
The goal of this project is to study the main features of both graphs and identify those users who publish or spread content.


- First, the declared network of twitter accounts has been visualized

- Second, the dynamic network of the tweets related with global warming has been visualized, both retweets and mentions on Twitter

## Some Dashboards in PowerBI

I worked on many dashboards in PowerBI, developed the tabular models in analysis services. In the visual below, you can see small sections taken from some dashboards.
